    Car Rental System 

 

Project Breakthrough: The system is divided into two parts: one for the users and the other for the system administrator. 

User part: 

    1.Login page: 

The login page is used by both the system administrator and the user where the user has two possibilities , either login to his/her account or to create a new account if he/she is a new user	.
